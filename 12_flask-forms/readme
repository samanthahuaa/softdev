DISCO:
 * The form submissions aren't saved by request.form
 * POST allows us to access the information that the user submits while GET doesn't
 * GET is used when we need to reload a page or boot it up. It seems like it's retreiving data to us
 * POST wasn't needed in the landing page but it was helpful for the auth page

QCC:
 * How can we better format/ get the request method used more easily?
 * What is the difference between request.args and request.form? We didn't see anything when we printed request.args at any point

 SUMMARY OF WHAT WE THINK IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GET AND POST:
 We think that POST helps us retreive data. It "posts" the data so that we can access it and manipulate it to our likings.
 We do not need POST for our landing page because there is no new data from the user that needs to be used/manipulated.
 GET does not allow us to do this. GET allows us to access our webpages. We think it's "getting" the data from them so that
 our webpages can load. Without GET on both our landing and auth page, our app would return an error. We also think that it
        changes the url of our page based on the user submission.
