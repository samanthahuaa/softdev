'''
DISCO:
 - It appears like only one function is run in the entire app and when you call other functions, their return values don't show up on the screen
 - To create line breaks, we need to use "<br>", in quotations. It does not literally print out <br> which we thought it would
 - app.debug was extremely helpful so that we would not need to start and stop our app every time we made an edit

QCC:
 - Is there a more efficient way to put information on the page rather than using string concatenation?
 - What is flask?
 - How can we incorporate other apps with different names? This one is named __main__ by default. Can we name other apps different names and interweave them?
 - How can we incorporate different functions?
