        We think that POST helps us retreive data. It "posts" the data so that we can access it and manipulate it to our likings.
        We do not need POST for our landing page because there is no new data from the user that needs to be used/manipulated.
        GET does not allow us to do this. GET allows us to access our webpages. We think it's "getting" the data from them so that
        our webpages can load. Without GET on both our landing and auth page, our app would return an error. We also think that it
        changes the url of our page based on the user submission.
