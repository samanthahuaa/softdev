DISCO:
 * Flexbox is really nice to create an adaptable website. When we zoomed in and out, the proportions of our columns remained the same
 * You can have multiple div classes within a div class
 * When you display: flex; and element, it treats div's as a single element which is really helpful
 * flex: number; is an abbreviation for flex-grow: number; but can be adapted for flew-shrink as well

QCC
 * There is a lot of documentation on CSS! Super nice and dandy
 * Using a color dropper extension helped us figure out what colors to use- it gives us the hex and the RBG name! Although you can't get it on your stuy account :(
