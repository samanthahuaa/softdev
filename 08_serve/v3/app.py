# What is debug mode?

# What we saw in the shell:
#  * Restarting with stat
# /usr/bin/python3: No module named thonny.plugins.cpython.app

# It worked in the terminal but didn't work in the thonny shell
# We saw debugger is active in the terminal and the PIN: 760-007-819
# No visual difference in the website
