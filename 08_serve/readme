K08 -- Putting it Together -- flask, debug, new line
2022-10-06
time spent: 0.8hrs

Notes:
 - Our flask apps did not run in Thonny. This is what happened when we did:
      What we saw in the shell:
      * Restarting with stat
      /usr/bin/python3: No module named thonny.plugins.cpython.app
      We saw debugger is active in the terminal and the PIN: 760-007-819
