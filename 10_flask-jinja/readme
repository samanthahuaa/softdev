time spent: 0.3hrs

Predictions:
- title of page will be fooooo
- each element in coll will be displayed on a new line
- % signifies the start of things that will be replaced
- app.py defines the variables utilized in the template to replace them

#Q0: What will happen if you remove render_template from this line? (log your prediction before you pull the trigger...)
if we remove render_template from this line, some sort of error will be displayed on the page

#Q1: Can all of your teammates confidently predict the URL to use to load this page?
ip address/my_foist_template

#Q2: What is the significance of each argument? Simplest, most concise answer best.
 return render_template( 'model_tmplt.html', foo="fooooo", collection=coll)
 first arg: jinja-formatted template file
 second and third arg: gives variables in template file meaning

 Results:
- Our predictions were right.
- The tab was named fooooo
- The http://127.0.0.1:5000/ link showed us "No hablo queso!"
- The http://127.0.0.1:5000/my_foist_template showed us:
