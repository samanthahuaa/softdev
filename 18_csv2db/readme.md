# K18 -- (Python+SQLite)3: A Mare Widge Made in Hebben -- sql tables fstrings .format insert tables
# 2022-10-26
# time spent: 1.0hrs

DISCO:
 * .format() allows us to put python variables inside strings
 * We got errors in our sqlite code when we tried to input values in a different order
 * We made ID the primary key in courses but this produced errors because ID was not a unique key for each row in the table
 * The order of the columns you create in a table don't matter.


QCC:
 * Why do the order of the columns not matter in its creation but the order of the columns in data insertion do?
 * The names of the students were EDM artists
 * We tried to use f strings and it did not work. T-T why.
