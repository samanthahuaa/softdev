# K14 -- Serving Looks -- eyedropper linking html to app 
# 2022-10-19
# time spent: .2hrs

DISCO:
 * We were pretty much able to copy paste our html and css from the last assignment and drop it into here
 * It's important to change the route of the css file when you link it in your html file. (it's in the static folder not templates where your html file is)
 * To get color dropper/picker tool, go to the consol and under style, fine any color box. When you pick the box, a color dropper should appear alongside the color wheel. If you click the dropper and hover it over the color you want to know the hex number of, it will appear! 

QCC:
 * flex was hard for us bro. but the inspect tool allowed us to visualize what needed to change and why our code wasn't working
 * We just copy pasted the copyright symbol. Is there an easier way to get it?
 * We utilized a lot of class time so there wasn't too much to do at home!! Meaning more sleep for us :D
